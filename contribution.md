# How to contribute

If you want to contribute code to Infrad, you can follow the process below for your development and submission

### Process

1. Check out the development branch from the master branch, for example: `feature-xxxx`
2. Develop under your own branch
3. After development is complete, run the following command in the console
   > `$ yarn test-all-develop`
4. If there is no problem, you can pull the latest content of the master branch to prevent your code from not including the latest changes of master, and then submit your code
5. Submit PR (MR) to the master branch on the github site, and fill in according to the PR template (type and changelog lists are required, others are optional)
